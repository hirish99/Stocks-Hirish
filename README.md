The purpose of this repository is to give a generic RothIRA allocation strategy, for Fidelity users.

What makes this strategy somewhat unique is that I have invested slightly into GOLD, and REITs. I explain the reason below.
I invest into the total US market (FZROX), large cap (FXAIX), small cap stocks (FSDMX).
I invest into the ex-US ETF (FTIHX) for diversification outside of America.
I invest into fixed-income Bonds (FXNAX).

Finally I invest in Gold/REITs as a hedge against inflation, Gold which is not Fidelity:

The US govt has proven that it will continue to spend more than it has, no matter what party is in control.
