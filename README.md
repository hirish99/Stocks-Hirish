The purpose of this repository is to give a generic RothIRA allocation strategy, for Fidelity users.

What makes this strategy somewhat unique is that I have invested slightly into GOLD, and REITs. I explain the reason below.
I invest into the total US market (FZROX), large cap (FXAIX), small cap stocks (FSDMX).
I invest into the ex-US ETF (FTIHX) for diversification outside of America.
I invest into fixed-income Bonds (FXNAX).

I invest in Gold/REITs as a hedge against inflation. Gold cannot be purchased through Fidelity easily:
